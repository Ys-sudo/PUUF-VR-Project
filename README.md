This is a small VR game where you have to collect the beers before the time runs out. Then your score is appended to highscores and the models are reseted back to their original positions. It uses raycaster for the VR mode to interact with the models, on the desktop you can click on them. You start or restart the game by clicking on the box right in front you. In VR mode you use the occulus touch controller to move around or on desktop - WASD or arrows. 

The project uses the following components:
- GLTFloader 
- aframe-enviroment-component
- aframe-extras
- aframe-htmlembed
- aframe-auto-detect-controller
- t.b.c.
